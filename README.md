# update unoffically

I put everything in ./patch directory.
due to Mr xie using GBK format on Windows, I can't recognise it on my Linux.
I extracted the all patches and converted into UTF-8 format.
The genpatch.sh and enca.sh (using to convert formats) is in ./patch directory.
There are all 2 original git-log files in it.

# Later I will talk about what commment Mr Xie commit.
